The spatial join pipeline takes as input two collections of spatial objects (e.g., polygons). In the filter step, pairs of object MBRs that intersect are identified and passed to the refinement step for verification of the join predicate on the exact object geometries. The bottleneck of spatial join evaluation is in the refinement step. We introduce APRIL, a powerful intermediate step in the pipeline, which is based on raster interval approximations of object geometries. Our technique applies a sequence of interval joins on 'intervalized' object approximations to determine whether the objects intersect or not. Compared to previous work, APRIL approximations are simpler, occupy much less space, and achieve similar pruning effectiveness at a much higher speed. Besides intersection joins between polygons, APRIL can directly be applied and has high effectiveness for polygonal range queries, within joins, and polygon-linestring joins. By applying a lightweight compression technique, APRIL approximations may occupy even less space than object MBRs. Furthermore, APRIL can be customized to apply on partitioned data and on polygons of varying sizes, rasterized at different granularities. Our last contribution is a novel algorithm that computes the APRIL approximation of a polygon without having to rasterize it in full, which is orders of magnitude faster than the computation of other raster approximations. Experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of APRIL; compared to the state-of-the-art intermediate filter, APRIL occupies 2x-8x less space, is 3.5x-8.5x more time-efficient, and reduces the end-to-end join cost up to 3 times.

                                                            Spatial data is generated daily from numerous sources such as GPS-enabled devices, consumer applications (e.g., Uber, Strava), and social media (e.g., location-tagged posts). This exponential growth in spatial data is driving the development of efficient spatial data processing systems. 

                                                            In this study, we enhance spatial indexing with a machine-learned search technique developed for single-dimensional sorted data. Specifically, we partition spatial data using six traditional spatial partitioning techniques and employ machine-learned search within each partition to support point, range, distance, and spatial join queries. By instance-optimizing each partitioning technique, we demonstrate that: (i) grid-based index structures outperform tree-based ones (from 1.23× to 2.27×), (ii) learning-enhanced spatial index structures are faster than their original counterparts (from 1.44× to 53.34×), (iii) machine-learned search within a partition is 11.79% - 39.51% faster than binary search when filtering on one dimension, (iv) the benefit of machine-learned search decreases in the presence of other compute-intensive operations (e.g. scan costs in higher selectivity queries, Haversine distance computation, and point-in-polygon tests), and (v) index lookup is the bottleneck for tree-based structures, which could be mitigated by linearizing the indexed partitions.

                                                        A recent trend in stream processing is offloading the computation of decomposable aggregation function (DAF) from cloud nodes to geo-distributed fog/edge devices to decrease latency and improve energy efficiency. However, deploying DAFs on low-end devices is challenging due to their volatility and limited resources. Additionally, in geo-distributed fog/edge environments, creating new operator instances on demand and replicating operators ubiquitously is restricted, posing challenges for achieving load balancing without overloading devices. Existing work predominantly focuses on cloud environments, overlooking DAF operator placement in resource-constrained and unreliable geo-distributed settings.

                                                        This paper presents NEMO, a resource-aware optimization approach that determines the replication factor and placement of DAF operators in resource-constrained geo-distributed topologies. Leveraging Euclidean embeddings of network topologies and a set of heuristics, NEMO scales to millions of nodes and handles topological changes through adaptive re-placement and re-replication decisions.  Compared to existing solutions, NEMO achieves up to 6x lower latency and up to 15x reduction in communication cost, while preventing overloaded nodes. Moreover, NEMO re-optimizes placements in constant time, regardless of the topology size. As a result, it lays the foundation to efficiently process continuous data streams on large, heterogeneous, and geo-distributed topologies.

                                                            The recent explosion in the number and size of spatial remote sensing datasets from satellite missions creates new opportunities for data-driven approaches in domains such as climate change monitoring and disaster management. These approaches typically involve a feature engineering step that summarizes remote sensing pixel data located within zones of interest defined by another spatial dataset, an operation called zonal statistics. While there exist several spatial systems that support zonal statistics operations, they differ significantly in terms of interfaces, architectures, and algorithms, making it hard for users to select the best system for a specific workload. To address this limitation, we propose Raven, a zonal statistics framework that provides users with a unified interface across multiple execution backends, while facilitating easy benchmarking and comparisons across systems. In this demonstration, we showcase several aspects of Raven, including its multi-backend execution environment, domain-specific declarative language, optimization techniques, and benchmarking capabilities.

                                                            The rate at which applications gather geospatial data today has turned data loading into a critical component of data analysis pipelines. However, users are confronted with multiple file formats for storing geospatial data and an array of systems for processing it. To shed light on how the choice of file format and system affects performance, this paper explores the performance of loading geospatial data stored in diverse file formats using different libraries. It aims to study the impact of different file formats, compare loading throughput across spatial libraries, and examine the microarchitectural behavior of geospatial data loading. Our findings show that GeoParquet files provide the highest loading throughput across all benchmarked libraries. Furthermore, we note that the more spatial features per byte a file format can store, the higher the data loading throughput. Our micro-architectural analysis reveals high instructions per cycle (IPC) during spatial data loading for most libraries and formats. Additionally, our experiments show that instruction misses dominate L1 cache misses, except for GeoParquet files, where data misses take over.

                                                            Spreadsheets are widely used for data exploration. Since spreadsheet systems have limited capabilities, users often need to load spreadsheets to other data
                                                            science environments to perform advanced analytics. However, current approaches for spreadsheet loading suffer from either high runtime or memory usage,
                                                            which hinders data exploration on commodity systems. To make spreadsheet loading practical on commodity systems, we introduce a novel parser that minimize memory usage by tightly coupling decompression and parsing. Furthermore, to reduce the runtime, we introduce optimized spreadsheet-specific parsing routines and employ parallelism. To evaluate our approach, we implement a prototype for loading Excel spreadsheets into R and Python environments. Our evaluation shows that our novel approach is up to 3x faster while consuming up to 40x less memory than state-of-the-art approaches.

                                                            Sketches are a popular approximation technique for large datasets and high-velocity data streams. While custom FPGA-based hardware has shown admirable throughput at sketching, the state-ofthe-art exploits data parallelism by fully replicating resources and constructing independent summaries for every parallel input value. We consider this approach pessimistic, as it guarantees constant processing rates by provisioning resources for the worst case. We propose a novel optimistic sketching architecture for FPGAs
                                                            that partitions a single sketch into multiple independent banks shared among all input values, thus significantly reducing resource consumption. However, skewed input data distributions can result in conflicting accesses to banks and impair the processing rate. To mitigate the effect of skew, we add mergers that exploit temporal locality by combining recent updates.Our evaluation shows that an optimistic architecture is feasible and reduces the utilization of
                                                            critical FPGA resources proportionally to the number of parallel input values. We further show that FPGA accelerators provide up to 2.6𝑥 higher throughput than a recent CPU and GPU, while larger sketch sizes enabled by optimistic architectures improve accuracy by up to an order of magnitude in a realistic sketching application.

                                                        <p> The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that allows numerous devices, potentially spread over a large geographical area, to collect and collectively process data from high-speed data streams. To that end, specialized IoT data management systems (IoTDMSs) have emerged. One challenge in those systems is the collection of different metrics from devices in a central location for analysis. This analysis allows IoTDMSs to maintain an overview of the workload on different devices and to optimize their processing. However, as an IoT network comprises of many heterogeneous devices with low computation resources and limited bandwidth, collecting and sending workload metrics can cause increased latency in data processing tasks across the network. In this ongoing work, we present an approach to avoid unnecessary transmission of workload metrics by predicting CPU, memory, and network usage using machine learning (ML). Specifically, we demonstrate the performance of two ML models, linear regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, and show the features that we explored to train these models. This work is part of an ongoing research to develop a monitoring tool for our new IoTDMS named NebulaStream.

                                                        <p>The rapid increase of traffic data generated by different sensing systems opens many opportunities to improve transportation services. 
                                                            An important opportunity is to enable high-resolution stochastic routing that computes the arrival time probabilities for each suggested route instead of only the expected travel time. 
                                                            Stochastic routing relies on stochastic speed data that captures the speed distributions of vehicles in a road network.
                                                            However, traffic datasets typically have many missing values, which prevents the construction of stochastic speeds. 
                                                            To address this limitation, we propose the Stochastic Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SST-GCN) architecture that accurately imputes missing speed distributions in a road network. 
                                                            SST-GCN combines Temporal Convolutional Networks and Graph Convolutional Networks into a single framework to capture both spatial and temporal correlations between road segments and time intervals, thereby providing a highly accurate estimation model for speed distributions. 
                                                            Moreover, to cope with datasets with many missing values, we propose a novel self-adaptive context-aware diffusion process that regulates the propagated information around the network, avoiding the spread of false information. 
                                                            We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of SST-GCN on real-world datasets, showing that it achieves from 4.6% to 50% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines using three different evaluation metrics. 
                                                            Furthermore, multiple ablation studies confirm our design choices and scalability to large road networks.

                                                        <p>The growing operational capability of global Earth Observation (EO) creates new opportunities for data-driven approaches to understand and protect our planet. 
                                                            However, the current use of EO archives is very restricted due to the huge archive sizes and the limited exploration capabilities provided by EO platforms. 
                                                            To address this limitation, we have recently proposed MiLaN, a content-based image retrieval approach for fast similarity search in satellite image archives. 
                                                            MiLaN is a deep hashing network based on metric learning that encodes high-dimensional image features into compact binary hash codes.
                                                            We use these codes as keys in a hash table to enable real-time nearest neighbor search and highly accurate retrieval.
                                                            In this demonstration, we showcase the efficiency of MiLaN by integrating it with EarthQube, a browser and search engine within AgoraEO.
                                                            EarthQube supports interactive visual exploration and Query-by-Example over satellite image repositories.
                                                            Demo visitors will interact with EarthQube playing the role of different users that search images in a large-scale remote sensing archive by their semantic content and apply other filters.

                                                        <p> The Tree-Encoded Bitmap (TEB) is a novel bitmap compression
                                                            scheme that provides a high compression ratio and logarithmic read
                                                            time. It uses a tree-based compression algorithm that maps runs in
                                                            the bitmap to leaf nodes of a binary tree. Currently, TEBs perform
                                                            updates using an auxiliary differential data structure. However,
                                                            consulting an additional data structure at every read introduces
                                                            both memory and read overheads. To mitigate the shortcomings of
                                                            differential updates, we propose algorithms to update TEBs in place.
                                                            To that end, we identified two types of updates that can occur in

                                                            All other updates are run-breaking. Each type of update requires
                                                            different handling. Through experimentation with synthetic data,
                                                            we determined that in-place run-forming updates are 2-3× faster
                                                            than differential updates, while run-breaking updates cannot be
                                                            efficiently performed in place. As a result, we propose a hybrid
                                                            solution that performs run-forming updates in place while storing
                                                            run-breaking updates in a differential data structure. Our experiments
                                                            using synthetic data show that our hybrid solution is faster
                                                            than differential updates as long as run-forming updates occur in
                                                            a given workload. For instance, when 7% of all updates are run
                                                            forming, our hybrid solution is 15% faster than differential updates.

                                                        <p> Spreadsheets are widely used for data exploration. Since spreadsheet
                                                            systems have limited capabilities, users often need to load
                                                            spreadsheets to other data science environments to perform
                                                            advanced analytics. However, current approaches for spreadsheet

                                                            which hinders data exploration on commodity systems. To make

                                                            a novel parser that minimizes memory usage by tightly
                                                            coupling decompression and parsing. Furthermore, to reduce the
                                                            runtime, we introduce optimized spreadsheet-specific parsing
                                                            routines and employ parallelism. To evaluate our approach, we
                                                            implement a prototype for loading Excel spreadsheets into R
                                                            environments. Our evaluation shows that our novel approach is
                                                            up to 3× faster while consuming up to 40× less memory than

                                                            stream data. To enable data-driven IoT applications, data management systems like NebulaStream have emerged that
                                                            manage and process data streams, potentially in combination with data at rest, in a heterogeneous distributed environment
                                                            of cloud and edge devices. To perform internal optimizations, an IoT data management system requires a monitoring
                                                            component that collects system metrics of the underlying infrastructure and application metrics of the running processing
                                                            tasks. In this paper, we explore the applicability of existing cloud-based monitoring solutions for stream processing engines
                                                            in an IoT environment. To this end, we provide an overview of commonly used approaches, discuss their design, and
                                                            outline their suitability for the IoT. Furthermore, we experimentally evaluate different monitoring scenarios in an IoT
                                                            environment and highlight bottlenecks and inefficiencies of existing approaches. Based on our study, we show the need for
                                                            novel monitoring solutions for the IoT and define a set of requirements.

                                                        <p> Today, interoperability among EO exploitation platforms is almost inexistent as most of them rely on a heterogeneous set of technologies with varying interfaces and data formats.
                                                            Thus, it is crucial to enable cross-platform (federated) analytics to make EO technology easily accessible to everyone.
                                                            We envision AgoraEO, an EO ecosystem for sharing, finding, composing, and executing EO assets, such as datasets, algorithms, and tools.
                                                            Making AgoraEO a reality is challenging for several reasons, the main ones being that the ecosystem must provide interactive  response times and operate seamlessly over multiple exploitation platforms.
                                                            In this paper, we discuss the different challenges that AgoraEO poses as well as our ideas to tackle them.
                                                            We believe that having an open, unified EO ecosystem would foster innovation and boost EO data literacy for the entire population.

                                                        <h4>Abstract</h4>
                                                        <p> Mobile devices have become ubiquitous; smartphones, tablets and wearables are essential
                                                            commodities for many people. The ubiquity of mobile devices combined with their ever increasing
                                                            capabilities, open new possibilities for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications where mobile devices
                                                            act as both data generators as well as processing nodes. However, deploying a stream processing
                                                            system (SPS) over mobile devices is particularly challenging as mobile devices change their position
                                                            within the network very frequently and are notoriously prone to transient disconnections. To deal
                                                            with faults arising from disconnections and mobility, existing fault tolerance strategies in SPS are
                                                            either checkpointing-based or replication-based. Checkpointing-based strategies are too heavyweight
                                                            for mobile devices, as they save and broadcast state periodically, even when there are no failures.
                                                            On the other hand, replication-based strategies cannot provide fault tolerance at the level of the data
                                                            source, as the data source itself cannot be always replicated. Finally, existing systems exclude mobile
                                                            devices from data processing upon a disconnection even when the duration of the disconnection is
                                                            very short, thus failing to exploit the computing capabilities of the offline devices. This paper proposes
                                                            a buffering-based reactive fault tolerance strategy to handle transient disconnections of mobile devices
                                                            that both generate and process data, even in cases where the devices move through the network during
                                                            the disconnection. The main components of our strategy are: (a) a circular buffer that stores the
                                                            data which are generated and processed locally during a device disconnection, (b) a query-aware
                                                            buffer replacement policy, and (c) a query restart process that ensures the correct forwarding of the
                                                            buffered data upon re-connection, taking into account the new network topology. We integrate our
                                                            fault tolerance strategy with NebulaStream, a novel stream processing system specifically designed for
                                                            the IoT. We evaluate our strategy using a custom benchmark based on real data, exhibiting reduction
                                                            in data loss and query latency compared to the baseline NebulaStream.

                                                        <h4>Abstract</h4>
                                                        <p> As individual traffic and public transport in cities are changing, city authorities need to analyze urban geospatial data to improve transportation and infrastructure. 
                                                            To that end, they highly rely on spatial aggregation queries that extract summarized information from point data (e.g., Uber rides) contained in a given polygonal region (e.g., a city neighborhood). 
                                                            To support such queries, current analysis tools either allow only predefined aggregates on predefined regions and are thus unsuitable for exploratory analyses, or access the raw data to compute aggregate results on-the-fly, which severely limits the interactivity. 
                                                            At the same time, existing pre-aggregation techniques are inadequate since they maintain aggregates over rectangular regions. 
                                                            As a result, when applied over arbitrary polygonal regions, they induce an approximation error that cannot be bounded.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p> In this paper, we introduce GeoBlocks, a novel pre-aggregating data structure that supports spatial aggregation over arbitrary polygons. 
                                                            GeoBlocks closely approximate polygons using a set of fine-grained grid cells and, in contrast to prior work, allow to bound the approximation error by adjusting the cell size. 
                                                            Furthermore, GeoBlocks employ a trie-like cache that caches aggregate results of frequently queried regions, thereby dynamically adapting to the skew inherently present in query workloads and improving performance over time. 
                                                            In summary, GeoBlocks outperform on-the-fly aggregation by up to three orders of magnitude, achieving the sub-second query latencies required for interactive exploratory analytics.

                                                        <h4>Abstract</h4>
                                                        <p> Spatial approximations have been traditionally used in spatial databases
                                                            to accelerate the processing of complex geometric operations.
                                                            However, approximations are typically only used in a first filtering
                                                            step to determine a set of candidate spatial objects that may
                                                            fulfill the query condition. To provide accurate results, the exact
                                                            geometries of the candidate objects are tested against the query
                                                            condition, which is typically an expensive operation. Nevertheless,
                                                            many emerging applications (e.g., visualization tools) require interactive
                                                            responses, while only needing approximate results. Besides,
                                                            real-world geospatial data is inherently imprecise, which makes
                                                            exact data processing unnecessary. Given the uncertainty associated
                                                            with spatial data and the relaxed precision requirements of
                                                            many applications, this vision paper advocates for approximate
                                                            spatial data processing techniques that omit exact geometric tests
                                                            and provide final answers solely on the basis of fine-grained approximations.
                                                            Thanks to recent hardware advances, this vision can be
                                                            realized today. Furthermore, our approximate techniques employ a
                                                            distance-based error bound, i.e., a bound on the maximum spatial
                                                            distance between false or missing and exact results which is crucial
                                                            for meaningful analyses. This bound allows to control the precision
                                                            of the approximation and trade accuracy for performance.

                                                        <p>Connected mobility applications rely heavily on geospatial joins that associate point data, such as locations of Uber cars, to static polygonal regions, such as city neighborhoods. These joins typically involve expensive geometric computations, which makes it hard to provide an interactive user experience.</p>
                                                        <p>In this paper, we propose an adaptive polygon index that leverages true hit filtering to avoid expensive geometric computations in most cases. In particular, our approach closely approximates polygons by combining quadtrees with true hit filtering, and stores these approximations in a query-efficient radix tree. Based on this index, we introduce two geospatial join algorithms: an approximate one that guarantees a user-defined precision, and an exact one that adapts to the expected point distribution. In summary, our technique outperforms existing CPU-based joins by up to two orders of magnitude and is competitive with state-of-the-art GPU implementations.</p>

The results of each query determine the combination of data sets to be queried next. Not knowing a priori the queried data sets makes it hard to choose an efficient indexing strategy.

We therefore develop STITCH, a novel index structure for the scalable execution of spatial range queries on multiple data sets. Instead of indexing all data sets separately or indexing all of them together, the key insight we use in STITCH is to partition all data sets individually and to connect them to the same reference space. By doing so, STITCH only needs to query the reference space and follow the links to the data set partitions to retrieve the relevant data. With experiments we show that STITCH scales with the number of data sets and outperforms the state-of-the-art by a factor of up to 12.3.</p>

                                                        <p>Core to many scientific and analytics applications are spatial data capturing the position or shape of objects in space, and time series recording the values of a process over time. Effective analysis of such data requires a shift from confirmatory pipelines to exploratory ones. However, there is a mismatch between the requirements of spatial and temporal data exploration and the capabilities of the data management solutions available today. First, traditional spatial query operators evaluate spatial relations with time-consuming geometric tests that oppose the interactivity expected from exploratory applications, creating an undue overhead. Second, spatial access methods are built on top of rough geometric object approximations that do not capture the complex structure and distribution of today’s spatial data and are thus inefficient. Third, traditional indexes are typically built upfront before queries can be processed and over single data attributes, thus precluding interactive accesses to interesting data subsets that may be specified with constraints on multiple attributes. Finally, existing access methods scale poorly with increasingly granular spatial and temporal data originating from ever more precise data acquisition technologies and ever faster computing infrastructure.</p>
                                                        <p>This thesis introduces a novel family of spatial and temporal access methods and query operators that aim to bridge the gap between existing data management techniques and data exploration applications. We show that spatial query operators can be decomposed into primitive graphics operations that are efficiently executed by graphics hardware (GPU) and allow to trade accuracy for interactivity. Furthermore, we design access methods that adapt to data characteristics, data growth trends, and workload access patterns, thereby providing scalable performance for ad-hoc queries over increasing data amounts. Specifically, we introduce a spatial approximation that adapts to the structural properties and distribution of the data, and propose spatial and time series access methods that leverage similarities between data items and support filtering over multiple attributes. Finally, we present an approach that indexes data incrementally, using queries as hints for optimizing data access.</p>

                                                        <p>The majority of spatial processing techniques rely heavily on 
                                                            approximating each group of spatial objects by their minimum bounding box (MBB).
                                                            As each MBB is compact to store (requiring only two multi-dimensional points)
                                                            and intersection tests between MBBs are cheap to execute, these approximations
                                                            are used predominantly to perform the (initial) filtering step of spatial data
                                                            processing. However, fitting (groups of) spatial objects into a rough box often
                                                            results in a very poor approximation of the underlying data. The resulting MBBs
                                                            contain a lot of “dead space”---fragments of bounded area that contain no
                                                            actual objects---that can significantly reduce the filtering efficacy.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>This paper introduces the general concept of a <strong>clipped</strong> bounding box (CBB) that addresses the principal disadvantage of MBBs, their poor
                                                            approximation of spatial objects. Essentially, a CBB “clips away” dead space 
                                                            from the corners of an MBB by storing only a few auxiliary points. 
                                                            On four popular R-tree implementations (a ubiquitous application
                                                            of MBBs), we demonstrate how minor modifications to the query algorithm
                                                            exploit auxiliary CBB points to avoid many unnecessary recursions into dead
                                                            space. Extensive experiments show that clipped R-tree variants
                                                            substantially reduce I/Os: e.g., by clipping the state-of-the-art revised
                                                            R*-tree we can eliminate on average 19% of I/Os.

                                                        <p>The recent explosion in the number and size of spatio-temporal data sets from urban environments and social sensors creates new opportunities for data-driven approaches to understand and improve cities. Visual analytics systems like Urbane aim to empower domain experts to explore multiple data sets, at different time and space resolutions. Since these systems rely on computationally-intensive spatial aggregation queries that slice and summarize the data over different regions, an important challenge is how to attain interactivity. While traditional pre-aggregation approaches support interactive exploration, they are unsuitable in this setting because they do not support ad-hoc query constraints or polygons of arbitrary shapes. To address this limitation, we have recently proposed Raster Join, an approach that converts a spatial aggregation query into a set of drawing operations on a canvas and leverages the rendering pipeline of the graphics hardware (GPU). By doing so, Raster Join evaluates queries on the fly at interactive speeds on commodity laptops and desktops. In this demonstration, we showcase the efficiency of Raster Join by integrating it with Urbane and enabling interactivity. Demo visitors will interact with Urbane to filter and visualize several urban data sets over multiple resolutions.

                                                        <p> Visual exploration of spatial data relies heavily on spatial aggregation queries that slice and summarize the data over different regions. These queries comprise computationally-intensive point-in-polygon tests that associate data points to polygonal regions, challenging the responsiveness of visualization tools. This challenge is compounded by the sheer amounts of data, requiring numerous such tests to be performed. Traditional pre-aggregation approaches are unsuitable in this setting since they fix the query constraints and support only rectangular regions. On the other hand, query constraints are defined interactively in visual analytics systems, and polygons can be of arbitrary shapes. In this paper, we convert a spatial aggregation query into a set of drawing operations on a canvas and leverage the rendering pipeline of the graphics hardware (GPU) to enable interactive response times. Our technique trades-off accuracy for response time by adjusting the canvas resolution, and can even provide accurate results when combined with a polygon index. We evaluate our technique on two large real-world data sets, exhibiting superior performance compared to index-based approaches.

                                                        <p>Advances in data acquisition—through more powerful supercomputers for simulation or sensors with better resolution—help scientists tremendously to understand natural phenomena. At the same time, however, it leaves them with a plethora of data and the challenge of analyzing it. Ingesting all the data in a database or indexing it for an efficient analysis is unlikely to pay off because scientists rarely need to analyze all data. Not knowing a priori what parts of the data sets need to be analyzed makes the problem challenging.

                                                            Tools and methods to analyze only subsets of this data are rather rare. In this paper we therefore present Space Odyssey, a novel approach enabling scientists to efficiently explore multiple spatial data sets of massive size. Without any prior information, Space Odyssey incrementally indexes the data sets and optimizes the access to data sets frequently queried together. As our experiments show, through incrementally indexing and changing the data layout on disk, Space Odyssey accelerates exploratory analysis of spatial data by substantially reducing query-to-insight time compared to the state of the art.

                                                            An increasing number of applications from finance, meteorology, science and others are producing time series as output. The analysis of the vast amount of time series is key to understand the phenomena studied, particularly in the simulation sciences, where the analysis of time series resulting from simulation allows scientists to refine the model simulated. Existing approaches to query time series typically keep a compact representation in main memory, use it to answer queries approximately and then access the exact time series data on disk to validate the result. The more precise the in-memory representation, the fewer disk accesses are needed to validate the result. With the massive sizes of today's datasets, however, current in-memory representations oftentimes no longer fit into main memory. To make them fit, their precision has to be reduced considerably resulting in substantial disk access which impedes query execution today and limits scalability for even bigger datasets in the future.

                                                            In this paper we develop RUBIK, a novel approach to compressing and indexing time series. RUBIK exploits that time series in many applications and particularly in the simulation sciences are similar to each other. It compresses similar time series, i.e., observation values as well as time information, achieving better space efficiency and improved precision. RUBIK translates threshold queries into two dimensional spatial queries and efficiently executes them on the compressed time series by exploiting the pruning power of a tree structure to find the result, thereby outperforming the state-of-the-art by a factor of between 6 and 23. As our experiments further indicate, exploiting similarity within and between time series is crucial to make query execution scale and to ultimately decouple query execution time from the growth of the data (size and number of time series).

                                                        <p> Music Information Retrieval is the interdisciplinary research area of retrieving information
                                                            from music. Automatic Music Transcription is a field of Music Information Retrieval. It aims
                                                            at extracting the pitches of notes and their timings from an audio signal as well as identifying
                                                            which instrument generated them. After extracting that information it has to be represented
                                                            in a form which is understandable to musicians and could be used to recreate the original
                                                            audio. Automatic Music Transcription, especially for polyphonic music, is a problem of Audio
                                                            Digital Signal Processing which remains open. Until today, an application that can reach the
                                                            capabilities of a trained musician doesn’t exist.

                                                            The goal of this diploma thesis is the study and the development of techniques and
                                                            algorithms for the Automatic Piano Music Transcription. Apart from an extensive review of the
                                                            relevant with Automatic Music Transcription literature, we present an onset detection method
                                                            for monophonic piano music and a multiple fundamental frequency (F0) estimation method for
                                                            polyphonic piano music. Onset detection is based on the Teager-Kaiser energy operator and a
                                                            Gabor filter bank, having the frequencies of the piano keys as the central frequencies. Similarly,
                                                            the multiple fundamental frequency estimation method evaluates the DTFT of the signal at
                                                            the specific frequencies of the piano notes. The polyphony order K is unknown and thus the
                                                            proposed algorithm aims at both inferring K and finding the fundamental frequencies. This
                                                            is done sequentially, starting from a monophonic assumption and continuing with plausible
                                                            combinations of higher polyphony order. Candidate combinations of notes are selected as best
                                                            matching the spectrum and some properties learned from the data. The final combination
                                                            which is selected is that of minimum squared error. Our experimental results show good
                                                            performance for both methods.
