                                                        <p>The rapid increase of traffic data generated by different sensing systems opens many opportunities to improve transportation services. 
                                                        An important opportunity is to enable high-resolution stochastic routing that computes the arrival time probabilities for each suggested route instead of only the expected travel time. 
                                                        Stochastic routing relies on stochastic speed data that captures the speed distributions of vehicles in a road network.
                                                        However, traffic datasets typically have many missing values, which prevents the construction of stochastic speeds. 
                                                        To address this limitation, we propose the Stochastic Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SST-GCN) architecture that accurately imputes missing speed distributions in a road network. 
                                                        SST-GCN combines Temporal Convolutional Networks and Graph Convolutional Networks into a single framework to capture both spatial and temporal correlations between road segments and time intervals, thereby providing a highly accurate estimation model for speed distributions. 
                                                        Moreover, to cope with datasets with many missing values, we propose a novel self-adaptive context-aware diffusion process that regulates the propagated information around the network, avoiding the spread of false information. 
                                                        We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of SST-GCN on real-world datasets, showing that it achieves from 4.6% to 50% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines using three different evaluation metrics. 
                                                        Furthermore, multiple ablation studies confirm our design choices and scalability to large road networks.

															However, the current use of EO archives is very restricted due to the huge archive sizes and the limited exploration capabilities provided by EO platforms. 
															To address this limitation, we have recently proposed MiLaN, a content-based image retrieval approach for fast similarity search in satellite image archives. 
															MiLaN is a deep hashing network based on metric learning that encodes high-dimensional image features into compact binary hash codes.
															We use these codes as keys in a hash table to enable real-time nearest neighbor search and highly accurate retrieval.
															In this demonstration, we showcase the efficiency of MiLaN by integrating it with EarthQube, a browser and search engine within AgoraEO.
															EarthQube supports interactive visual exploration and Query-by-Example over satellite image repositories.
															Demo visitors will interact with EarthQube playing the role of different users that search images in a large-scale remote sensing archive by their semantic content and apply other filters.

														<p> The Tree-Encoded Bitmap (TEB) is a novel bitmap compression
															scheme that provides a high compression ratio and logarithmic read
															time. It uses a tree-based compression algorithm that maps runs in
															the bitmap to leaf nodes of a binary tree. Currently, TEBs perform
															updates using an auxiliary differential data structure. However,
															consulting an additional data structure at every read introduces
															both memory and read overheads. To mitigate the shortcomings of
															differential updates, we propose algorithms to update TEBs in place.
															To that end, we identified two types of updates that can occur in
															a TEB: run-forming and run-breaking updates. Run-forming updates
															correspond to leaf nodes at the lowest level of the binary tree.
															All other updates are run-breaking. Each type of update requires
															different handling. Through experimentation with synthetic data,
															we determined that in-place run-forming updates are 2-3× faster
															than differential updates, while run-breaking updates cannot be
															efficiently performed in place. As a result, we propose a hybrid
															solution that performs run-forming updates in place while storing
															run-breaking updates in a differential data structure. Our experiments
															using synthetic data show that our hybrid solution is faster
															than differential updates as long as run-forming updates occur in
															a given workload. For instance, when 7% of all updates are run
															forming, our hybrid solution is 15% faster than differential updates.

														<p> Spreadsheets are widely used for data exploration. Since spreadsheet
															systems have limited capabilities, users often need to load
															spreadsheets to other data science environments to perform
															advanced analytics. However, current approaches for spreadsheet
															loading suffer from either high runtime or memory usage,
															which hinders data exploration on commodity systems. To make
															spreasheet loading practical on commodity systems, we introduce
															a novel parser that minimizes memory usage by tightly
															coupling decompression and parsing. Furthermore, to reduce the
															runtime, we introduce optimized spreadsheet-specific parsing
															routines and employ parallelism. To evaluate our approach, we
															implement a prototype for loading Excel spreadsheets into R
															environments. Our evaluation shows that our novel approach is

														<p> The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly growing into a network of billions of interconnected physical devices that constantly
															stream data. To enable data-driven IoT applications, data management systems like NebulaStream have emerged that
															manage and process data streams, potentially in combination with data at rest, in a heterogeneous distributed environment
															of cloud and edge devices. To perform internal optimizations, an IoT data management system requires a monitoring
															component that collects system metrics of the underlying infrastructure and application metrics of the running processing
															tasks. In this paper, we explore the applicability of existing cloud-based monitoring solutions for stream processing engines
															in an IoT environment. To this end, we provide an overview of commonly used approaches, discuss their design, and
															outline their suitability for the IoT. Furthermore, we experimentally evaluate different monitoring scenarios in an IoT
															environment and highlight bottlenecks and inefficiencies of existing approaches. Based on our study, we show the need for
															novel monitoring solutions for the IoT and define a set of requirements.

														<p> Today, interoperability among EO exploitation platforms is almost inexistent as most of them rely on a heterogeneous set of technologies with varying interfaces and data formats.
															Thus, it is crucial to enable cross-platform (federated) analytics to make EO technology easily accessible to everyone.
															We envision AgoraEO, an EO ecosystem for sharing, finding, composing, and executing EO assets, such as datasets, algorithms, and tools.
															Making AgoraEO a reality is challenging for several reasons, the main ones being that the ecosystem must provide interactive  response times and operate seamlessly over multiple exploitation platforms.
															In this paper, we discuss the different challenges that AgoraEO poses as well as our ideas to tackle them.
															We believe that having an open, unified EO ecosystem would foster innovation and boost EO data literacy for the entire population.

														<p> Mobile devices have become ubiquitous; smartphones, tablets and wearables are essential
															commodities for many people. The ubiquity of mobile devices combined with their ever increasing
															capabilities, open new possibilities for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications where mobile devices
															act as both data generators as well as processing nodes. However, deploying a stream processing
															system (SPS) over mobile devices is particularly challenging as mobile devices change their position
															within the network very frequently and are notoriously prone to transient disconnections. To deal
															with faults arising from disconnections and mobility, existing fault tolerance strategies in SPS are
															either checkpointing-based or replication-based. Checkpointing-based strategies are too heavyweight
															for mobile devices, as they save and broadcast state periodically, even when there are no failures.
															On the other hand, replication-based strategies cannot provide fault tolerance at the level of the data
															source, as the data source itself cannot be always replicated. Finally, existing systems exclude mobile
															devices from data processing upon a disconnection even when the duration of the disconnection is
															very short, thus failing to exploit the computing capabilities of the offline devices. This paper proposes
															a buffering-based reactive fault tolerance strategy to handle transient disconnections of mobile devices
															that both generate and process data, even in cases where the devices move through the network during
															the disconnection. The main components of our strategy are: (a) a circular buffer that stores the
															data which are generated and processed locally during a device disconnection, (b) a query-aware
															buffer replacement policy, and (c) a query restart process that ensures the correct forwarding of the
															buffered data upon re-connection, taking into account the new network topology. We integrate our
															fault tolerance strategy with NebulaStream, a novel stream processing system specifically designed for
															the IoT. We evaluate our strategy using a custom benchmark based on real data, exhibiting reduction
															in data loss and query latency compared to the baseline NebulaStream.

														<p> As individual traffic and public transport in cities are changing, city authorities need to analyze urban geospatial data to improve transportation and infrastructure. 
															To that end, they highly rely on spatial aggregation queries that extract summarized information from point data (e.g., Uber rides) contained in a given polygonal region (e.g., a city neighborhood). 
															To support such queries, current analysis tools either allow only predefined aggregates on predefined regions and are thus unsuitable for exploratory analyses, or access the raw data to compute aggregate results on-the-fly, which severely limits the interactivity. 
															At the same time, existing pre-aggregation techniques are inadequate since they maintain aggregates over rectangular regions. 
															As a result, when applied over arbitrary polygonal regions, they induce an approximation error that cannot be bounded.
														</p>
														<p>	In this paper, we introduce GeoBlocks, a novel pre-aggregating data structure that supports spatial aggregation over arbitrary polygons. 
															GeoBlocks closely approximate polygons using a set of fine-grained grid cells and, in contrast to prior work, allow to bound the approximation error by adjusting the cell size. 
															Furthermore, GeoBlocks employ a trie-like cache that caches aggregate results of frequently queried regions, thereby dynamically adapting to the skew inherently present in query workloads and improving performance over time. 
															In summary, GeoBlocks outperform on-the-fly aggregation by up to three orders of magnitude, achieving the sub-second query latencies required for interactive exploratory analytics.

														<p> Spatial approximations have been traditionally used in spatial databases
															to accelerate the processing of complex geometric operations.
															However, approximations are typically only used in a first filtering
															step to determine a set of candidate spatial objects that may
															fulfill the query condition. To provide accurate results, the exact
															geometries of the candidate objects are tested against the query
															condition, which is typically an expensive operation. Nevertheless,
															many emerging applications (e.g., visualization tools) require interactive
															responses, while only needing approximate results. Besides,
															real-world geospatial data is inherently imprecise, which makes
															exact data processing unnecessary. Given the uncertainty associated
															with spatial data and the relaxed precision requirements of
															many applications, this vision paper advocates for approximate
															spatial data processing techniques that omit exact geometric tests
															and provide final answers solely on the basis of fine-grained approximations.
															Thanks to recent hardware advances, this vision can be
															realized today. Furthermore, our approximate techniques employ a
															distance-based error bound, i.e., a bound on the maximum spatial
															distance between false or missing and exact results which is crucial
															for meaningful analyses. This bound allows to control the precision
															of the approximation and trade accuracy for performance.

														<p> The arising Internet of Things (IoT) will require significant changes to current stream processing engines (SPEs) to enable
															large-scale IoT applications. In this paper, we present challenges and opportunities for an IoT data management system to
															enable complex analytics beyond the cloud. As one of the most important upcoming IoT applications, we focus on the vision
															of a smart city. The goal of this paper is to bridge the gap between the requirements of upcoming IoT applications and the
															supported features of an IoT data management system. To this end, we outline how state-of-the-art SPEs have to change to
															exploit the new capabilities of the IoT and showcase how we tackle IoT challenges in our own system, NebulaStream. This
															paper lays the foundation for a new type of systems that leverages the IoT to enable large-scale applications over millions of
															IoT devices in highly dynamic and geo-distributed environments. </p>

These joins typically involve expensive geometric computations, which makes it hard to provide an interactive user experience.</p>
                                                        

                                                        <p>In this paper, we propose an adaptive polygon index that leverages true hit filtering to avoid expensive geometric computations in most cases. In particular, our approach closely approximates polygons by combining quadtrees with true hit filtering, and stores these approximations in a query-efficient radix tree. Based on this index, we introduce two geospatial join algorithms: an approximate one that guarantees a user-defined precision, and an exact one that adapts to the expected point distribution. In summary, our technique outperforms existing CPU-based joins by up to two orders of magnitude and is competitive with state-of-the-art GPU implementations.</p>

                                                        <p>Efficiently querying multiple spatial data sets is a growing challenge for scientists. 
														Astronomers query data sets that contain different types of stars (e.g. dwarfs, giants, stragglers) while neuroscientists query different data sets that model different aspects of the brain in the same space (e.g. neurons, synapses, blood vessels). The results of each query determine the combination of data sets to be queried next. Not knowing a priori the queried data sets makes it hard to choose an efficient indexing strategy.</p>

														<p>In this paper, we show that indexing and querying the data sets separately incurs considerable overhead but so does using one index for all data sets. We therefore develop STITCH, a novel index structure for the scalable execution of spatial range queries on multiple data sets. Instead of indexing all data sets separately or indexing all of them together, the key insight we use in STITCH is to partition all data sets individually and to connect them to the same reference space. By doing so, STITCH only needs to query the reference space and follow the links to the data set partitions to retrieve the relevant data. With experiments we show that STITCH scales with the number of data sets and outperforms the state-of-the-art by a factor of up to 12.3.</p>

                                                        <p>Core to many scientific and analytics applications are spatial data capturing the position or shape of objects in space, and time series recording the values of a process over time. Effective analysis of such data requires a shift from confirmatory pipelines to exploratory ones. However, there is a mismatch between the requirements of spatial and temporal data exploration and the capabilities of the data management solutions available today. First, traditional spatial query operators evaluate spatial relations with time-consuming geometric tests that oppose the interactivity expected from exploratory applications, creating an undue overhead. Second, spatial access methods are built on top of rough geometric object approximations that do not capture the complex structure and distribution of today’s spatial data and are thus inefficient. Third, traditional indexes are typically built upfront before queries can be processed and over single data attributes, thus precluding interactive accesses to interesting data subsets that may be specified with constraints on multiple attributes. Finally, existing access methods scale poorly with increasingly granular spatial and temporal data originating from ever more precise data acquisition technologies and ever faster computing infrastructure.</p>           
                                                        <p>This thesis introduces a novel family of spatial and temporal access methods and query operators that aim to bridge the gap between existing data management techniques and data exploration applications. We show that spatial query operators can be decomposed into primitive graphics operations that are efficiently executed by graphics hardware (GPU) and allow to trade accuracy for interactivity. Furthermore, we design access methods that adapt to data characteristics, data growth trends, and workload access patterns, thereby providing scalable performance for ad-hoc queries over increasing data amounts. Specifically, we introduce a spatial approximation that adapts to the structural properties and distribution of the data, and propose spatial and time series access methods that leverage similarities between data items and support filtering over multiple attributes. Finally, we present an approach that indexes data incrementally, using queries as hints for optimizing data access.</p>

                                                        <p>The majority of spatial processing techniques rely heavily on 
														approximating each group of spatial objects by their minimum bounding box (MBB).
														As each MBB is compact to store (requiring only two multi-dimensional points)
														and intersection tests between MBBs are cheap to execute, these approximations
														are used predominantly to perform the (initial) filtering step of spatial data
														processing. However, fitting (groups of) spatial objects into a rough box often
														results in a very poor approximation of the underlying data. The resulting MBBs
														contain a lot of “dead space”---fragments of bounded area that contain no
														actual objects---that can significantly reduce the filtering efficacy.
														</p>

														<p>This paper introduces the general concept of a <strong>clipped</strong> bounding box (CBB) that addresses the principal disadvantage of MBBs, their poor
														approximation of spatial objects. Essentially, a CBB “clips away” dead space 
														from the corners of an MBB by storing only a few auxiliary points. 
														On four popular R-tree implementations (a ubiquitous application
														of MBBs), we demonstrate how minor modifications to the query algorithm
														exploit auxiliary CBB points to avoid many unnecessary recursions into dead
														space. Extensive experiments show that clipped R-tree variants
														substantially reduce I/Os: e.g., by clipping the state-of-the-art revised
														R*-tree we can eliminate on average 19% of I/Os.

                                                        <p>The recent explosion in the number and size of spatio-temporal data sets from urban environments and social sensors creates new opportunities for data-driven approaches to understand and improve cities. Visual analytics systems like Urbane aim to empower domain experts to explore multiple data sets, at different time and space resolutions. Since these systems rely on computationally-intensive spatial aggregation queries that slice and summarize the data over different regions, an important challenge is how to attain interactivity. While traditional pre-aggregation approaches support interactive exploration, they are unsuitable in this setting because they do not support ad-hoc query constraints or polygons of arbitrary shapes. To address this limitation, we have recently proposed Raster Join, an approach that converts a spatial aggregation query into a set of drawing operations on a canvas and leverages the rendering pipeline of the graphics hardware (GPU). By doing so, Raster Join evaluates queries on the fly at interactive speeds on commodity laptops and desktops. In this demonstration, we showcase the efficiency of Raster Join by integrating it with Urbane and enabling interactivity. Demo visitors will interact with Urbane to filter and visualize several urban data sets over multiple resolutions.

These queries comprise computationally-intensive point-in-polygon tests that associate data points to polygonal regions, challenging the responsiveness of visualization tools. This challenge is compounded by the sheer amounts of data, requiring numerous such tests to be performed. Traditional pre-aggregation approaches are unsuitable in this setting since they fix the query constraints and support only rectangular regions. On the other hand, query constraints are defined interactively in visual analytics systems, and polygons can be of arbitrary shapes. In this paper, we convert a spatial aggregation query into a set of drawing operations on a canvas and leverage the rendering pipeline of the graphics hardware (GPU) to enable interactive response times. Our technique trades-off accuracy for response time by adjusting the canvas resolution, and can even provide accurate results when combined with a polygon index. We evaluate our technique on two large real-world data sets, exhibiting superior performance compared to index-based approaches.

                                                        <p>Advances in data acquisition—through more powerful supercomputers for simulation or sensors with better resolution—help scientists tremendously to understand natural phenomena. At the same time, however, it leaves them with a plethora of data and the challenge of analyzing it. Ingesting all the data in a database or indexing it for an efficient analysis is unlikely to pay off because scientists rarely need to analyze all data. Not knowing a priori what parts of the data sets need to be analyzed makes the problem challenging.
														</p>
														<p>
														Tools and methods to analyze only subsets of this data are rather rare. In this paper we therefore present Space Odyssey, a novel approach enabling scientists to efficiently explore multiple spatial data sets of massive size. Without any prior information, Space Odyssey incrementally indexes the data sets and optimizes the access to data sets frequently queried together. As our experiments show, through incrementally indexing and changing the data layout on disk, Space Odyssey accelerates exploratory analysis of spatial data by substantially reducing query-to-insight time compared to the state of the art.

                                                        	An increasing number of applications from finance, meteorology, science and others are producing time series as output. The analysis of the vast amount of time series is key to understand the phenomena studied, particularly in the simulation sciences, where the analysis of time series resulting from simulation allows scientists to refine the model simulated. Existing approaches to query time series typically keep a compact representation in main memory, use it to answer queries approximately and then access the exact time series data on disk to validate the result. The more precise the in-memory representation, the fewer disk accesses are needed to validate the result. With the massive sizes of today's datasets, however, current in-memory representations oftentimes no longer fit into main memory. To make them fit, their precision has to be reduced considerably resulting in substantial disk access which impedes query execution today and limits scalability for even bigger datasets in the future.

															In this paper we develop RUBIK, a novel approach to compressing and indexing time series. RUBIK exploits that time series in many applications and particularly in the simulation sciences are similar to each other. It compresses similar time series, i.e., observation values as well as time information, achieving better space efficiency and improved precision. RUBIK translates threshold queries into two dimensional spatial queries and efficiently executes them on the compressed time series by exploiting the pruning power of a tree structure to find the result, thereby outperforming the state-of-the-art by a factor of between 6 and 23. As our experiments further indicate, exploiting similarity within and between time series is crucial to make query execution scale and to ultimately decouple query execution time from the growth of the data (size and number of time series).

														<p>	Music Information Retrieval is the interdisciplinary research area of retrieving information
															from music. Automatic Music Transcription is a field of Music Information Retrieval. It aims
															at extracting the pitches of notes and their timings from an audio signal as well as identifying
															which instrument generated them. After extracting that information it has to be represented
															in a form which is understandable to musicians and could be used to recreate the original
															audio. Automatic Music Transcription, especially for polyphonic music, is a problem of Audio
															Digital Signal Processing which remains open. Until today, an application that can reach the
															capabilities of a trained musician doesn’t exist.
														</p>
														<p>
															The goal of this diploma thesis is the study and the development of techniques and
															algorithms for the Automatic Piano Music Transcription. Apart from an extensive review of the
															relevant with Automatic Music Transcription literature, we present an onset detection method
															for monophonic piano music and a multiple fundamental frequency (F0) estimation method for
															polyphonic piano music. Onset detection is based on the Teager-Kaiser energy operator and a
															Gabor filter bank, having the frequencies of the piano keys as the central frequencies. Similarly,
															the multiple fundamental frequency estimation method evaluates the DTFT of the signal at
															the specific frequencies of the piano notes. The polyphony order K is unknown and thus the
															proposed algorithm aims at both inferring K and finding the fundamental frequencies. This
															is done sequentially, starting from a monophonic assumption and continuing with plausible
															combinations of higher polyphony order. Candidate combinations of notes are selected as best
															matching the spectrum and some properties learned from the data. The final combination
															which is selected is that of minimum squared error. Our experimental results show good
															performance for both methods.
